# From-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-to-Machine-Learning-to-Deep-Learning
This is a great reproducible project for anyone who wants to learn how to build any Machine Learning Model starting from the scratch with easy-to-understand code implementation. 

Please be patient when you are going through the project to comprehend the application of all the nice methods. If you need any help please don't hesitate to knock me with the code snippet. 

In this project, I have developed a robust pipeline for Exploratory data analysis, Data Preprocessing, Building ML and Deep Learning Models. I have used three different datasets (Iris, Planets, Titanic) for data exploration. I have used the most popular classification algorithms, and finally Tensorflow (Keras) for building Deep Learning models. On the Titanic dataset, I have been able to reach an accuracy of 83% on the test dataset.
